## Hey ! Welcome to Selenite Studio 🕹️

We chose Github to build, deploy and share our project ! Selenite is an independent game project as part of our studies in the University Bachelor of Technology, Multimedia and Internet Professions (BUT in French). We're 6 students : [Alison Guilloré](https://github.com/AlisonGlr), [Clément Omnès](https://github.com/Clementmns), [Antonin Leroux](https://github.com/AntoninLEROUX), [Titouan Lahchiouach](https://github.com/TitouanLahchiouach), [Liam Make](https://github.com/makeliam) and [Pierre Guéroult](https://github.com/pierregueroult), and we have a school year to product a complete game.
